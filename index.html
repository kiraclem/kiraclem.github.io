<h2>bugs:</h2>
<h3> One bug I had, was while creating information to be loaded without react,
    I wanted to load certian informatiom from a database to a user if the conditions were right. 
    However even though I was appending the elements into the html, it would not load. 

    Usually when I encounter bugs, the first thing I do is try and narrow down the problem,
    so I can figure out exactly what is going on. 
    In this case, there could be multiple problems, perhaps there is a problem
    with the way I was appending the html, or perhaps a bigger problem was going, like the 
    server wasn't recognizing the data coming from the server. 
    That's why I chose to break it down into smaller steps. 
    If I tried to append a simple hi message would it work?
    If I console logged the res.data from the server would it show up properly?
    It turns out in this case, hi loaded fine as well as the res.data,
    so I understood that there was probably a syntax error in my code, or I forgot to 
    append something. Which was exactly the case.

<h2>project building:</h2>
<h3>I feel like approaching new projects take a similar approach to bug fixing. 
    Make something simple work first, before you add the complex stuff. It can save time coding, 
    and allow you to detect bugs sooner.

<h2>projects:</h2>
<h3>My very first project
    was a simple adopt website I created. 

    I used javascript, html and css to create it. 
    As well as axios, dotenv, sequelize, express, and cors.

    During the project I learned just how detailed and intracate projects can be,
    as well as why organization is important. The more information you have 
    the easier it can be to not know where things are. It also makes it easier to
    modify or change things in the future if it's written better. I can definently see 
    the importance of simplicity. Not repeating yourself allows you to quickly make changes without having to find all the 
    diffrent places in your code that it's different. This project definently showed me
    my areas of weakness and what I could improve on. I would love to improve my ability to be able to create faster
    and cleaner code and I hope as more projects get posted, that that will be evident in my code.
