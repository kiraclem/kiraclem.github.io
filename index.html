                <div class="div-box"> <p> Hello, let me introduce a little about myself.
                I was born and raised in Utah. I enjoy spending time with friends and family and going out and doing things.
                I also love to be outside in nature. There are many different things I enjoy doing in my freetime, and many more
                I would like to learn to do. Some of my hobbies include art, music, blender, reading and some of my topics of interest include astronomy,
                phsycology and the power of mindset. </p>

    <h3>bugs:</h3>
        <p> One bug I had, was while creating information to be loaded without react,
            I wanted to load certian informatiom from a database to a user if the conditions were right. 
            However even though I was appending the elements into the html, it would not load. </p>

        <p> Usually when I encounter bugs, the first thing I do is try and narrow down the problem, 
            so I can figure out exactly what is going on. 
            In this case, there could be multiple problems, perhaps there is a problem
            with the way I was appending the html, or perhaps a bigger problem was going, like the 
            server wasn't recognizing the data coming from the server. 
            That's why I chose to break it down into smaller steps. 
            If I tried to append a simple hi message would it work?
            If I console logged the res.data from the server would it show up properly?
            It turns out in this case, hi loaded fine as well as the res.data,
            so I understood that there was probably a syntax error in my code, or I forgot to 
            append something. Which was exactly the case. </p>

    <h3>project building:</h3>
        <p>I feel like approaching new projects take a similar approach to bug fixing. 
            Make something simple work first, before you add the complex stuff. It can save time coding, 
            and allow you to detect bugs sooner. </p>
